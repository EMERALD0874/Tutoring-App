# Docere Backend

## Requirements

You will need to install Docker to run the database locally.

Postman or a similar API testing tool is recommended.

## Starting the DB

Build the project docker image with `docker-compose build`
Run the project container with `docker-compose up`
Stop the container with CTRL-C and then run `docker-compose down` to remove the container
